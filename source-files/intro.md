# Objectives of Pharmacovigilance

Pharmacovigilance has been defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine-related problem.

The two most important concepts in pharmacovigilance are opposites: harm and safety. The usual term for harm related to a medicine is an adverse drug reaction (ADR) and pharmacovigilance is fundamentally about preventing and managing these ADRs.

Pharmacovigilance is an activity contributing to the protection of patients' and public health.
